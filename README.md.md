# JavaScript Exercise: Accessing User Information Navigator Object
Here I was gaining experience learning different aspects of the user's device by accessing different parts of the BOM's navigator object. There are simple methods for finding length/height and user language. To discover the user's browser and operating system, you must first access userAgent from navigator and then search the string for specific terms. Finally, we use GetBattery to access the user's Battery API and specific information. Not all browsers provide this information however, so it won't function on all devices. 


## Features
Provides the following details about a user's device: 
- System (OS, browser, and language)
- Window (width, height, orientation)
- Battery (Percentage of charge and charging status)*

*Not available on all devices
